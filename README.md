# Servant

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clearcare/servant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clearcare/servant)

A python package to build services/microservices.

See the `examples` folder to see what a service server and client look like.
 
**_ATTENTION!_**

This is experimental and the API may not be entirely stable. Having said that, it's currently being
used in production at [Clearcare](http://clearcareonline.com) and as such, is supported well.

Eventually the transport payload/structure should be standardized so that clients/servers can be 
authored in different languages.
