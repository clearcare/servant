[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brianz/servant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brianz/servant)

A python package to build services/microservices.

See the `examples` folder to see what a service server and client look like.
 
**_ATTENTION!_**

This is highly experimental and in flux. Eventually the transport payload

languates.
